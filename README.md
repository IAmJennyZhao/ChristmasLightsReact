# Christmas Lights

Just a cute color change light project that simulates christmas lights. 

## Changing Themes

Inspiration of themes all came from [ColorHex](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/1483).
Below is a demo video of the different themes I implemented.

## Changing Speeds

Below is a demo video of how changing the speed changes the lights.
